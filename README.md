# URScript Examples

This repository contains examples of URScript, the script language for the robot controller from Universal Robots.\
URScript allows you to program the robot with more flexibility than Polyscope, the standard graphical user interface programming interface. Though can be used in combination.\
This repo is meant to complement the Script manual, which you can find at [help.universal-robots.com](https://help.universal-robots.com).

The goal is to make this repo grow over time with more examples and contributions.\
You are welcome to submit pull requests if you have any ideas or improvements.


### Suggestions

If you want to develop URScript code more easily, you might want to use:

- [URSim Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/u/universalrobots), which lets you run a simulated robot on your computer.
- [External Control URCap with the simple server example](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ExternalControl_URCap/tree/master/examples/simple_external_control_server), which enables you to send URScript commands from an external device to the robot.
- [VScode plugin for URScript](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ahern.urscript) made by Ahern Guo, which provides syntax highlighting and auto-completion for URScript in Visual Studio Code.
